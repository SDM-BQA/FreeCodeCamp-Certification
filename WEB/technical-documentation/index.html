                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
                control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
                for example:
            </div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                    another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                    server.

            <div class="para">
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
                basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
                common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
                special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

            <div class="para">
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or

                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"

                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are

                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                function.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
                (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
                following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
                global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
                this case is an if statement.
            </div>
            <div class="code">if (true) { var x = 5; } <br>console.log(x); // 5</div>

                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                variables using the window.variable syntax.

                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared
                in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                parent.phoneNumber.

                identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and

                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block

                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
